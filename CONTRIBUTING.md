## Contribution guidelines

Contributions in the form of bug reports and fixes are always welcome!

We also welcome pull requests that add new features, such as adding new map styles. However, if you are interested in this, please contact us before starting (for example by starting a [discussion](https://github.com/tue-alga/cartocrow/discussions)) so we can determine if your contribution would be in scope for the project.
