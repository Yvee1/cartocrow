# GeoViz intention (initial)

For the start of this GeoViz project, I want to generate as a 'byproduct' a kind of blank template for this type of project. This template should enable a new developer to more easily generate a project that includes the following functionality:

A website that uses the following things:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* AJAX
- PHP (for C++ binary)

This website should run a C++ executable that uses the following things:
* Separation of (static) library and executable.
* CMake with subdirectory structure.
- Installation (remove default directory from where the website would run it).
- Produces output that can be used by website.

There should also be some 'administrative' stuff around this:
- Licenses for both code and website.
- Readme for how to install and use.
- Documentation of code (doxygen?)
- scripts for: building and installing code into website directory, serving website locally, creating documentation.
