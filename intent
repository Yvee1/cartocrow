# GeoViz intention (initial)

For the start of this GeoViz project, I want to generate as a 'byproduct' a kind of blank template for this type of project. This template should enable a new developer to more easily generate a project that includes the following functionality:

A website that uses the following things:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* AJAX

This website should run a C++ executable that uses the following things:
* Separation of (static) library and executable
* CMake with subdirectory structure
* Installation into directory from where the website would run it

There should also be some 'administrative' stuff around this:
* Licenses for both code and website.
* Readme for how to install and use.
* Documentation of code (doxygen?)
* scripts for: building and installing code, serving website locally.
