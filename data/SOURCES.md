The europe.ipe file is based on data from [naturalearthdata.com](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/).

The file example_isolines.ipe contains isolines generated from [The Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA)](https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/rema/).
These DEMs were provided by the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center and the Polar Geospatial Center under NSF-OPP awards 1043681, 1542736, 1543501, 1559691, 1810976, and 2129685.
See the end of the file for the relevant bibliography [3, 4].

The file nyc.txt contains the locations of hotels, subway entrances, and medical clinics (green) in lower Manhattan.
It is a common benchmark dataset that originates from the paper that introduced Bubble Sets [1].
The point locations were manually traced from the image in the paper.

The file diseasome.txt contains vertices of an embedded graph of disorders, from the human
disease network constructed by Goh et al. [2]. The dataset consists of 516 vertices (disorders) of
twenty-one disorder classes. We use the graph layout of a poster by Bastian and Heymann archived at 
https://web.archive.org/web/20121116145141/http://diseasome.eu/data/diseasome_poster.pdf.

The file gemeenten-2022_5000vtcs.ipe contains generalized municipalities of The Netherlands,
generated from the [Wijk- en buurtkaart 2022](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/dossier/nederland-regionaal/geografische-data/wijk-en-buurtkaart-2022); © Kadaster / Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, 2024.
The file apotheek_gemiddelde_afstand_in_km.csv is one statistical data attribute present in the same Wijk- en buurtkaart.

The kinetic_kelp/air-traffic-france.csv file is a filtered version of https://doi.org/10.57745/PVQSEV.
